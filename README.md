# TutorTree Application Challenge
The challenge was to build a simple forum page.

The page should:
 - Be blank on startup (except for the title and create post button)
 - Provide a modal for creating or replying to posts
 - Allow users to upvote / downvote
 - Stay as close to the design as possible

A live build of the page can be found at [https://kingultron99.github.io/tutortree-challenge/](https://kingultron99.github.io/tutortree-challenge/)
